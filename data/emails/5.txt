b'Hi, I am trying to train my model with a for loop: for i in epochs:
model.train(sentences, epochs=1, total_examples=model.corpus_count) take the
word vectors (matrix), apply some changes (I need a np matrix) put those
updated vectors back into my model Do you know what must be done in order to
achieve it? I know that I could access the vectors via model.wv.vectors, but
will these vectors change in my whole model? I am sorry, I am just not so
experienced with programming, trying to do harder things than I can code :)

Hi,

  

I am trying to train my model with a for loop:

  

for i in epochs:

Â Â model.train(sentences, epochs=1, total_examples=model.corpus_count)Â

Â Â take the word vectors (matrix), apply some changes (I need a np matrix)

Â Â put those updated vectors back into my model

  

Do you know what must be done in order to achieve it? I know that I could
access the vectors via model.wv.vectors, but will these vectors change in my
whole model?Â

  

I am sorry, I am just not so experienced with programming, trying to do harder

' b'Hi, I am trying to train my model with a for loop: for i in epochs:
model.train(sentences, epochs=1, total_examples=model.corpus_count) take the
word vectors (matrix), apply some changes (I need a np matrix) put those
updated vectors back into my model Do you know what must be done in order to
achieve it? I know that I could access the vectors via model.wv.vectors, but
will these vectors change in my whole model? I am sorry, I am just not so
experienced with programming, trying to do harder things than I can code :)

Hi,

  

I am trying to train my model with a for loop:

  

for i in epochs:

Â Â model.train(sentences, epochs=1, total_examples=model.corpus_count)Â

Â Â take the word vectors (matrix), apply some changes (I need a np matrix)

Â Â put those updated vectors back into my model

  

Do you know what must be done in order to achieve it? I know that I could
access the vectors via model.wv.vectors, but will these vectors change in my
whole model?Â

  

I am sorry, I am just not so experienced with programming, trying to do harder
things than I can code :)

  

Greetings,

Jakub
